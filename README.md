# **Instacart-Basket-Analysis-Python**

I utilized Python to process and analyze multiple datasets for Instacart. This project includes a comprehensive report detailing the analysis process, results, and recommendations addressing key business questions posed by Instacart.

## **Objective**
Instacart, an online grocery store operating via an app, already boasts strong sales. However, they aim to uncover deeper insights into their sales patterns. The goal is to perform initial data and exploratory analysis to derive actionable insights and suggest strategies for improved segmentation based on provided criteria.

## **Key Questions**
- **Busiest Times**: What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day in terms of orders? This information will help schedule ads during less busy times.
- **Spending Patterns**: Are there specific times of the day when people spend the most money? This could influence the types of products advertised at these times.
- **Price Range Groupings**: Instacart has a wide range of product prices. Can simpler price range groupings help direct marketing and sales efforts?
- **Product Popularity**: Which types of products are more popular? Which departments have the highest frequency of product orders?
- **Customer Segmentation**: How do different types of customers and their ordering behaviors differ? This includes:
  - Distribution of brand loyalty
  - Differences in ordering habits based on loyalty status, region, age, and family status
  - Classifications suggested by demographic information (age, income, types of goods, family status)
  - Ordering habits of different customer profiles (price, frequency, products ordered)

## **Data**
- **Orders**
- **Orders_Products_Prior**
- **Products**
- **Customers**
- **Departments**

The customer dataset and the column 'prices' were added to the original dataset for learning purposes in the CareerFoundry course.

## **Tools**
The data analysis was performed using Python and the following libraries:
- **Pandas**: For data analysis
- **Numpy**: For mathematical operations
- **Seaborn**: For data visualizations
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualizations
- **Scipy**: For statistical computations
- **Warnings**: To suppress warnings

## **Folders**
The project files are organized into the following folders:
- **Project Management**: Includes the Project Brief and Data Dictionary.
- **Data**: Separated into two subfolders, Original Data and Prepared Data. These contain the original data frames and the cleaned and prepared data frames, respectively. (Data files are not uploaded to GitHub due to size.)
- **Scripts**: Jupyter notebooks containing the analysis code.
- **Analysis**: The Visualizations folder contains visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.
- **Sent to Client**: The final report presented in Excel.

## **Resources**
Note: Instacart is a real company that has made their data available online. However, the contents of the attached project brief have been fabricated by CareerFoundry for the purpose of this analysis.
